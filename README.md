# GUI-2D-TEMPLATE1
A Graphical User Interface designed as a template &amp; practice for a future project in 3D graphics.

This coding project is a template for a future design I will be working on. I am going to implement 3D graphics and physics to better show the animations. It is a step I'm taking in order to understand coding physics and progress my career in coding.
With that being said here are some visuals of my code.

-This Visual is my opening frame that allows the user to go to 2 separate windows. Number 1 being a preset menu and the other being a "Customizable Drink Menu". The customizable drink menu demonstrates the action of adding alcohol and mixers to the glass.

Here is my Second frame. Here I selected a lemondrop which displays on the frame after selecting, as well as it being added to the "Shopping Cart". There are buttons that allow drink removal from the cart and finishing your order to display a total price.

Here is my Third frame. Here I have multiple buttons that allow you to choose what type of drink you want mixed together. When added the stream and glass changes in color. This is an especially important feature as with 3D capabilities I will be able to
mess around with fluid physics, and do some color mixing to add a more realistic & appealing liquid effect.
